# cby.li

A dead-simple link shortener written in Clojure.

## Goals

* Fun.
* Minimal dependencies.
* Something I can self-host.
* Nice reminders of recently created links!

## Development

```sh
export BASE_URI=https://cby.li
export ENV=production
clojure -M:repl
```

## TODO

* Validation
* Nice UX to check whether a given short URL exists, as you type
